					<h2>CTA</h2>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row 50% uniform">
							<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/OfficialCta.png" alt="" /></span></div>
					<p>For my CTA I wanted to incorporate a main button that says ‘Learn More.’ for people to click on the homepage first. After my interview with TSDI’s owner Melissa, I found out that she primarily wanted people to read about what the organization is able to do first before anything else. That way before they fill out an application for a service dog they know just what kind of services TSDI are able to do. Over the ‘Learn More’ button I decided to add a description that will say ‘We are here to provide the best services to provide the best service dog for you’. It would be a good way to inform the general public about their service dogs as well, giving them a chance to understand how they operate and how others enjoy the organization.</p>
					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					<p>After all the information was gathered I started to put together my style tile. The style tile is a mood board that helps feature the website's attributes demonstrating typefaces, buttons to scale, adjectives, and what a homepage might look like.</p>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row 50% uniform">
							<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/TSDI2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
					<br>
			 	  </br>
				  <p>For my style tile I wanted it to look clean and informative. For The Service Dog Institute as my clients they wanted to be able to show their knowledge in the field by being able to demonstrate what they can do along with a welcoming feel. I chose the adjectives informative, caring, clear, quality, clean, hopeful, and personal to really get the point of a open and well informed organization. For my typeface I chose Brandon Grotesque, this typeface has multiple styles to it to easily be the only typeface used on the page. It also is a welcoming typeface with a lighter childlike feel that could make any person feel welcomed using this site.</p>
					<br>
				</br>
				  <p>Going with the colors blue, orange, a pastel turquoise, and dark grey, it gives the website a good life and variety. The blue helps give a calming but knowledgable feel with a good orange contrast that leads your eye right to the CTA. This gets more of the idea across that the visitor of the site should press the 'Learn More' button to find out what The Service Dog Institute has to offer.</p>
					<br>
				</br>
				  <p>With the elements of the style tile completed I wanted to go back in and change the logo of the organization. Originally it was just a temple building with some orange behind it, but that did not fit the feeling of service dogs. Instead I kept the idea of the building but made the edges round to have a welcoming feel, then traced the outline of a dogs paw to really tie it all together. The new welcoming logo along side the bright colors and happy tone of the page will brighten up the Service Dog Institutes site all around.</p>
