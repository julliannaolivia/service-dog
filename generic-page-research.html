			<h4><strong>Primary Research</strong></h4>
			<div>
			<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 3.53.19 PM.png" alt="" /></span>After choosing The Service Dog Insttitute as my projects focus I went straight into looking into their website finding where all their features are. The Service Dog Institute or TSDI has a simple layout, however, could benifit from describing their trainors or showing the dogs they are able to have in their establishment. Normally on a site like this you would like to see the dogs that they have or an updated list on events. But, while searching through it feels more neglected rather than their Facebook page.</p>
			<br>
		</br>
			<p><b>Seeing these features of their website I wanted to focus on some aspects for them.</b></p>
			   <ol>
					 <li>A place to see pictures of the dogs.</li>
					 <li>Somewhere to find the trainers who work with the dogs.</li>
					 <li>A place to show updates or events that the institute is hosting.</li>
				 </ol>
			</div>
			<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-09-18 at 5.02.15 PM.png" alt="" /></span>Knowing what aspects I wanted to focus on I decided to turn my attention to other service dog websites. That is when I came across a site called Service Dog Certifications. What I thought was particularly interesting was that this site had a blog attatched to them to show recent events going on. TSDI could definitly use this aspect to demonstrate what is going on recently instead of only using Facebook. There is even an area for people to leave comments which would be benificial to directly contacting the organization or for people to read other's feed back directly on the site.

  	<h4><strong>Secondary Research</strong></h4>
			<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-09-20 at 2.21.06 PM.png" alt="" /></span>In the next phase of this project I branched out to other resources other than Service Dog sites. I wanted to implement the idea of people researching their dog's trainer from this babysitting app called Bubble. How it works is that people are able to look at the page the babbysitter filled out and choose which one they believe would be a good match. They could message the dog instructer and check to see their page on who they are. This would help the person who needs the dog trained be put at ease knowing their dog is in good hands.</p>
			<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-09-20 at 2.26.14 PM.png" alt="" /></span>I also wanted to check out other non profit sites, just to see how they use their website effectively. It would be a nice benifit to add the different sections on the home page, like how this organization has theirs displayed. This would help direct the client right where they would need to go in a simple effective method.</p>

			<h3>Ads</h3>
			<p class="info">How The Service Dog Institue markets in their area</p>
		</header>
			<p>While going through The Service Dog Institute's Facebook I saw that they plug into their local area with ads from Bi-Lo where you can buy a bag and they get a donation. Then even branching out into places like Amazon, so when you purchased back to school supplies you are able to donate to the Institute.</p>
