						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">Who is my audience and what do I want to accomplish?</p>
					</header>

					<h2>My Audience</h2>
					<p>Diving into who my audience would be there was two seperate catagories they could fall into.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Direct</li>
						<p>These are the primary people who would come in contact with the organization. These people are the owner of the dog, the donators, trainers, and caretakers of the dog.</p>
						<li>Secondary</li>
						<p>These are the people who may come in contact but not on the regular. These people would be family, friends, schools, work places.</p>
					</ul>
					<p>Below is what my progress was after figuring out the direct and secondary people who would come in contact. By organizing the fans, and people who might be against the ideas then seeing what the client, audience, and website would be able to do for the organization.</p>

	    <h2>Goals from my Interviews</h2>
			 <p class="info">Who are the clients and owner?</p>
		 </header>
			<p>For my interviews I talked to a couple people who were clients of the organization and also the owner of TSDI.</p>
			<p>During my interviews I learned that these clients were split hearing about the website from word of mouth and a simple search of service dog trainers near me. It seemed that this is a tighter community who are involved with each other. I did expect to hear that the website needed to provide more specific information. But what I did not expect was that the owner of TSDI did not want to be too popular in numbers.</p>
			<p>Instead of being overboard in members and applications Melissa Yetter, the owner of TSDI, wants the community to stay smaller to have that personal touch. If they do grow in any way that is one thing she does not want to lose. The primary goal Melissa wants is to be sure they have a representation for providing quality service dogs.</p>
      <p>From talking to the people who have used this organization they seem to have a good reputation as is, so this website will have to prove to keep that standard. One factor that would have to be added is that instead of going right to an application process, people are able to be informed about what specifically TSDI can provide. This did change my idea of having an easy way to apply to sharing upfront information about the company before applying.</p>
