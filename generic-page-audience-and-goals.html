						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">Who is my audience and what do I want to accomplish?</p>
					</header>

					<h2>My Audience</h2>
					<p>Diving into who my audience would be there was two seperate catagories they could fall into.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Direct</li>
						<p>These are the primary people who would come in contact with the organization. These people are the owner of the dog, the donators, trainors, and caretakers of the dog.</p>
						<li>Secondary</li>
						<p>These are the people who may come in contact but not on the regular. These people would be family, friends, schools, work places.</p>
					</ul>
					<p>Below is what my progress was after figuring out the direct and secondary people who would come in contact. By organizing the fans, and people who might be against the ideas then seeing what the client, audience, and website would be able to do for the organization.</p>

			  <h2>My Goals</h2>
				<p>For this site I want to be able to demonstrate three main goals.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>To provide easy accesibility to learn about the organization and what they do.</li>
					<li>Being able to see your trainor or the trainers being able to sign up to help with the organization.</li>
					<li>To see the dogs that they have at the institute or are currently training.</li>
				</ol>
