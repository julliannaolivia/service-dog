						 <li><p><b>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</b></p>
							   <p>To bring over the information and stories they tell on facebook onto their website by presenting the dogs in a clearer light rather than just pages of text with no pictures.</p></li>
						 <li><p><b>Now, state the ultimate impact you’re trying to have?</b></p>
                 <p>Making it easy to find informative on how you can apply to train or sign up to have a service dog to be trained through their website. Also giving them information on past experiences or events happening that are easily accessible.</p></li>
						 <li><p><b>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</b></p>
						     <p>Being able to show the graduates of the Service Dog Institute or show pictures of the dogs that they are able to train or easier way you’re able to find people who can train your dog
                 </p></li>
						 <li><p><b>Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facing.</b></p>
							   <p>Not enough visual information about the animals themselves, not as active on their website like they are on their facebook page.
		             I want to be able to show updates from their own website rather than just the facebook page
							   </p></li>
						<li><p><b>Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</b></p>
							   <p>Being able to easily find the dogs and the trainers with information and stories that can be shown in a clearer light on their website.</p></li>
